        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Poaching eggs is a deceptively complicated task. Thankfully, I have discovered a fool-proof method for making the perfect, teardrop-shaped poached egg every time.</p>
        <p>The key to beautiful poached eggs is using enough water, swirling the water before adding the egg, and discarding the outer, less-viscous egg white.</p>
        <p>The whole process takes 15 minutes, and yields one poached egg.</p>
        
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 clean ramekins</li>
            <li>a fine mesh sieve</li>
            <li>1 tbsp  white vinegar</li>
            <li>6 cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup of cold water</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add water and vinegar to a 1-quart saucepan and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Crack the egg into the fine mesh sieve over the ramekin, allowing the outer egg white to drip through the sieve.</li>
            <li>Transfer the egg from the sieve into the other clean ramekin.<li>
            <li>Store the excess egg white in the fridge for use in other recipes.</li>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon, vigorously swirl the boiling water in the saucepan until it creates a vortex in the middle. (Water depth and velocity of the swirl is key to achieving the teardrop shape)</li>
            <li>While the water is still swirling, gently tip the egg out of the ramekin into the water.</li>
            <li>Allow the water to come back up to a light simmer.</li>
            <li>For runny yolks, cook for 3 minutes. For jammy yolks, cook for 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the egg with the slotted spoon, and dip in cold water to stop the cooking.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
