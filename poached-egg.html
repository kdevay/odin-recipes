        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Poaching eggs is a deceptively complicated task. Thankfully, I have discovered a fool-proof method for making the perfect, teardrop-shaped poached egg every time. The key to beautiful poached eggs is using deep enough water, swirling the water before adding the egg, and discarding the outer, less-viscous egg white.</p>
        <p>The addition of vinegar to the poaching liquid does not effect the flavor, and ensures that egg whites will firm up quickly, further ensuring the teardrop shape.</p>
        <p>The whole process takes 15 minutes, and yields one poached egg.</p><br><br>
        
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 clean ramekins</li>
            <li>fine mesh sieve</li>
            <li>1 tbsp  white vinegar</li>
            <li>6 cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup of cold water</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h4 >Steps</h4>
        <ol class="step">
            <li>Add water and vinegar to a 2-quart saucepan and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Crack the egg into the fine mesh sieve over the ramekin, allowing the outer egg white to drip through the sieve.</li>
            <li>Transfer the egg from the sieve into the other clean ramekin.</li>
            <li>Store the excess egg white in the fridge for use in other recipes.</li>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon, vigorously swirl the boiling water in the saucepan until it creates a deep vortex in the middle. (Water depth and velocity of the swirl is key to achieving the teardrop shape)</li>
            <li>While the water is still swirling, gently tip the egg out of the ramekin into the water.</li>
            <li>Use the slotted spoon to keep the water swirling, carefully avoiding the egg, until the white turns from translucent to opaque.</li>
            <li>For runny yolks, cook for 3 minutes. For jammy yolks, cook for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the egg with the slotted spoon, and dip in cold water to stop the cooking and remove any excess white.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
